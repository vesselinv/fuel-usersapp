#The Power of FuelPHP

## Description

This is the sample app app on my The Power of FuelPHP series.

The series is an attempt to familiarize ourselves with FuelPHP, which in my opinion shows the beauty of php and the MVC pattern. It not only gets us cooking sophisticated apps in no time, but also makes us better programmers - OOP, TDD, Dependency Injection and other modern and best industry principles are at its core.
